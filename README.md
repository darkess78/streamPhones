Computer-to-Phone Control

This project automates the management and monitoring of multiple Android devices from a computer using ADB, scrcpy, and custom batch scripts. 

It is built to support real-time streaming, connection monitoring, automatic reconnection, and device-specific window positioning. 

It is optimized for use across Wi-Fi (including Tailscale for double NAT environments) and supports multiple devices with unique IP:port configurations.

Project Structure

stream.bat - Main launcher for all Android devices

monitor.bat - Per-device connection monitor and scrcpy relauncher

launch_*.bat - Auto-generated launchers per device (e.g., launch_Pixel2XL.bat)

shutdown.log - Log generated by shutdown process

adbconnect.bat - Optional: Batch script to pair multiple devices using ADB over Wi-Fi

Requirements

Windows OS

scrcpy

ADB installed and available in PATH

Devices connected via ADB TCP/IP (initial pairing must be done manually or using adbconnect.bat)

Optional: Tailscale for remote device access across different networks

Setup and Usage

Configure Devices

go to devices.txt

change file to 

deviceName, ip:port 

deviceName2, ip:port 
...

Run the Main Launcher

Double-click stream.bat or run it via CMD.

Monitor and Reconnect Automatically

Each device will open a persistent monitor.bat window that restarts scrcpy if it disconnects.

Shutdown Cleanly

Enter "q" when prompted to close all windows cleanly and log the shutdown.

Notes

Window positions are customizable per device (e.g., 0 30, 640 30, etc.)

monitor.bat ensures that scrcpy stays running and handles reconnection automatically

Device ports may change after reboot; adjust accordingly or implement dynamic port scanning if needed

This setup works even when devices are on different networks using Tailscale

Troubleshooting

CMD Window Closes Immediately: Ensure monitor.bat includes a persistent loop or wait

Ports Keep Changing: Consider assigning static ADB ports or scanning dynamically

Double NAT Issues: Use Tailscale or reverse SSH tunnels
